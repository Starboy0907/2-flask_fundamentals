Overview
Objectives:
Recap the past few days
Provide an outline of the concepts we'll be learning in Flask
Flask Flow

Congratulations on making it this far! Let's review the fundamental building blocks we have learned so far.

The syntax of Python
The basic building blocks -- variables, loops, lists, conditionals
Functions and how to use them
OOP classes -- attributes, methods, and how to use them
In this chapter, we will use a micro-framework called Flask to teach you the main components of web applications. Here are the concepts we'll focus on in this chapter:

Rendering Templates
Redirecting
Form data
GET & POST requests
Session
Flask Flow

In the image above, we can see how a basic flask application works.

Flow:

The HTTP request is made and hits the server.py file.
Based on the route we give, it gathers up any HTML, CSS, JS, and data.
Then it responses back to the browser with what we return.
Eventually we will be breaking down the functionality of the Flask server into separate parts, but for now this is our simple server.
